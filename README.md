## Data and Visualizations of Interest
https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/3-business-problems-data-analytics-can-help-solve

This journal article is interesting to me because I am also interested in business (hence my minor) and I would love to see how data science and user analytics can be utilized by maximize business and product profits.

I like this data visualization because it shows how data can be utilized to make informed product decisions. It shows how a user flow happens with mass data which is so important for how designers make their design and stylistic choices. 

## Ideas for Data to Investigate
1. Media Studies and Social Media Analytics
2. Connection between thought and langauge
3. Consumption of Music

## Ideas from Curated Datasets & Project Lists
| Name of Dataset | Description of Data | Link to Data |
| :--------------:| :------------------:| :-----------:|
| Heart Disease   | 4 databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and the VA Long Beach; The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. Coding could be helpful in creating filter algorithms to quickly identify if a pateint has heart disease or not. |https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease |
| Bank Marketing | Data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portugese banking institution. This could be interesting as the data informs the bank which marketing campaigns are working so they know how to better allocate their resources. | https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing |
|USA Jail Deaths | Data and Key Findings about deaths by state in US jails. Coding could be interesting in this because we could see if certain states how more death than others and what could potentially be causing those unnecessary deaths. | https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-jails-graphic/ |
| Contemporary Art at Carnegie Museum | This release contains data on approximately 28269 objects across all departments of the museum; fine arts, decorative arts, photography, contemporary art, and the Heinz Architectural Center. Code could be useful for this as it can differentiate the different categories from one another. | https://github.com/cmoa/collection |
